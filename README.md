# Math Guided Self-Placement Example

This is the guided self-placement tool built by the math department for Pierce College District in Washington state.  

The design of the tool was predicated on our full shift to a corequisite model, with intermediate algebra for precalculus being the only pre-college math course still offered. 

The initial placement is based on previous high school and college coursework.  Confidence rating questions are used to provide additional guideance and make small adjustments to the placement recommendation.

This tool was built in a rush, and was not designed for easy adaptability, but you are welcome to use it as a model or starting point if it would prove useful.
